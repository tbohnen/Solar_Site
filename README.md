# Solar_Site
This is my Solar Charge controller website

This website is used to send rf commands to my arduino from my Raspberry PI.

Right now it's extremely rudimentary but will flesh it out as I go along.

Currently it will send a request to my Arduino via RfSwitch library and 433 mhz Rf modules to switch lights off or on.

1 - Off
2 - On
